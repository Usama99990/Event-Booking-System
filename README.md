Event Booking System - C Programming Fundamentals Project

This Event Booking System is developed in C as a Programming Fundamentals project. It provides a console-based application for managing event bookings with features including:
- User Account Management: Allows users to create accounts, login, and view their account details securely using encryption.
- Event Browsing and Booking: View available events with detailed descriptions and book tickets by selecting categories and specifying the number of tickets.
- Ticket Information Management: Keeps track of purchased tickets and displays details of current bookings.
- Interactive User Interface: Utilizes custom console designs and fullscreen capabilities for a user-friendly experience.

The project integrates file handling, modular programming with custom headers, and encryption/decryption techniques to enhance data security and manage event data efficiently.
